School project for Network Applications and Network Administration.

Simple SMTP client. The connection to the server is not encrypted.

Implementation details
----------------------
SMTP client application written using C++. This implementation uses OOP approach.
Application consist of four classes.

`Envelope` and 'Message' are used as data models.
`ArgParser` focuses on argument parsing and validation. It fills the data models.
After filling the models with valid data, the `Client` class instance is created.
All communication with the SMTP server happens within the `Client`.

```sh
$ ./smtpclient [ -a IP ] [ -p port] [ -i file ] [ -w seconds ]
```
